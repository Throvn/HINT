Explaination from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures
stb_image.h is a very popular single header image loading library by Sean Barrett
that is able to load most popular file formats and is easy to integrate in your project(s).
stb_image.h can be downloaded from https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h.
Simply download the single header file, add it to your project as stb_image.h and create an
additional C++ file with the following code:
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_image.h"
By defining STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION the preprocessor modifies the header file such that it
only contains the relevant definition source code, effectively turning the header file into
a .cpp file, and that's about it. Now simply include stb_image.h somewhere in your program
and compile.
