# HINT
Sources and Documentation for Viewing HINT files under Win32

The HintView.sln and HintView.vcproj are made with MS Visual Studio 2005.
This is not exactly a current development environment, but probably easier
to upgrade to a more recent version, than downgrading a recent version
to an old version that somen might have. That does not mean that this
will stay that way indefinitely.
