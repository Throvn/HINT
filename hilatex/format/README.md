# Format files

## Description
Format files contain definitions necessary to run TeX.
Runing hitex will load hitex.fmt, running hilatex will load hilatex.fmt.
Format files for hitex are independent of the operating system.
Using the kpathsearch library, hitex will find the format file
as part of the TeX Live installation in the texmf-var/web2c/hitex/
subdirectory.

## Generation and Installation
Format files can be generated using the hitex executable and the
TeX sources provided as part of TeX Live using if desired also
updated files from the base subdirectory. After generating the
format files they can be kept for example in the current directory
or in the texmf-var/web2c/hitex/  subdirectory of TeX Live.

The hitex.fmt is a modified version of TeX's plain format.
It is generated by

hitex -ini -etex hitex.ini

The hilatex.fmt is a modified LaTeX format.
It is generated by

hitex -ini -etex -ltx hilatex.ini
