A: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as equation~\ref{firsteq}
and equation~\ref{secondeq} that come at the end of it.
On the following pages is equation~\ref{lasteq}.
B: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
C: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
D: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
E: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
F: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
G: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
H: This is a pretty lengthy paragraph that might not fit
in its entirety on the same page as the two formulas
that come at the end of it.
And here are two silly equations:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i\to\infty}{1 \over i^2}\label{firsteq}
\end{equation}
and
\makeatletter
\c@equation=7
\makeatletter
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i= 1}^\infty{1 \over i^2}.\label{secondeq}
\end{equation}
Which concludes the paragraph.

\newpage
The start of the last page is here.

\penalty -100

And the last equation is: 

\begin{equation}
\sum_{k= 1}^\infty{1 \over k*k}\label{lasteq}
\end{equation}

And this is the end of the document.
